## üÜò Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication failed. Your API Key appears to be invalid"**
- Verify your API key at [app.amber.com.au/developers](https://app.amber.com.au/developers)
- Ensure key has proper permissions for usage data access
- Check for typos or extra spaces in the key field

**"No sites found for this API key"**
- Confirm your Amber account is fully activated
- Ensure you have an active electricity connection with Amber
- Contact Amber support if the issue persists

**Slow Performance or Timeouts**
- Try smaller date ranges (1-2 weeks) for initial analysis
- Clear browser cache and IndexedDB storage
- Check browser console for specific error messages
- Use the progress log to identify bottlenecks

**Data Discrepancies**
- Verify date ranges don't extend into the future
- Check that supplier rate templates match your actual tariff
- Remember that traditional supplier costs are estimates
- Consider seasonal variations in usage patterns

### Getting Help
1. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
2. **Review API permissions** in Amber developer portal

## üí° Tips for Best Results

### Data Analysis
- **Use full monthly periods** for accurate cost comparisons
- **Compare similar seasons** (summer vs summer) for consistency
- **Monitor demand charges** - small changes in peak usage can have big cost impacts
- **Track solar generation** patterns to optimize feed-in timing

### Performance Optimization
- **Start with recent data** (last 1-3 months) for faster initial loading
- **Export data regularly** to build historical archives
- **Use templates** instead of custom rates when possible for accuracy
- **Collapse configuration panel** after setup to reduce visual clutter

### Cost Optimization Insights
- **Identify usage patterns** that coincide with high spot prices
- **Analyze controlled load timing** for hot water optimization
- **Monitor demand windows** to avoid peak charges
- **Compare different supplier structures** to find the best fit for your profile
